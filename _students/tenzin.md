"I first became acquainted with the OURS Office during the summer after my freshman year. Having just finished working as a research assistant for Prof. Sharrow of the Political Science Department that spring, I was eager to see what other research opportunities UMass had available which is how I came across OURS. After reaching out to Deb Phillis with my career interests and resume, she helped me to locate a research intern position with local non-profit Verite in Amherst, MA. After submitting my application and competing a phone interview, I received the position.

The research experience I gained with Verite was invaluable. I worked on labor rights projects collecting data, translating Spanish news articles and compiling country reports pertaining to South America and Indonesia. The work was very rewarding because the reports which Verite publishes, advocating for workers who may not have a voice, are in accord with my values of and future aspirations of working in the Foreign Service and serving as an advocate and voice for voiceless people. Having successfully finished my internship with Verite, this summer, I will be interning in Washington D.C at the Department of State in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor in the Office of International Religious Freedom."
