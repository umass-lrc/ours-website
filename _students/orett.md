"Hi, my name is Orett Burke, Jr. and I am a junior studying biology. I transferred to UMass Amherst last spring semester of 2015 from Dickinson College. I am currently working on a FDA funded project in Dr. Zoeller's lab. My project focuses on how bis-phenol A affects the thyroid hormone during brain development. However, during my first semester here, I wanted to find a "REU" or internship that met my needs. Debra Phillis of the OURS office scrutinized several programs in order to find the program most suitable for me. She made an overwhelming process much easier through her persistence and dedication to help me out. With her help I was able to get accepted into the Institute for Cellular Engineering program at UMass Amherst. During the summer I did research in Dr. Tew's lab in the Conte research building for Polymer Science and Engineering. My project focused on designing polymeric protein mimics for siRNA delivery. At the end of the program I was able to present my research to other members of the program and PhDs. I am very grateful to have met Ms. Phillis because she assisted me in finding an opportunity that created my foundation in medicine."
