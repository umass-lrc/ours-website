"My name is Linda Nguyen and I am a junior microbiology major and Spanish minor. I was first introduced to Debra Phillis at the OURS office during my second semester of freshman year. Not knowing where to begin, Deb first learned about my interests and then skillfully compiled for me a list of professors conducting research pertaining to such themes. Despite not being able to find a lab that semester, Deb encouraged me to contact other professors. The following semester, I joined Dr. Rich’s lab at the Laboratory of Medical Zoology. Through this opportunity, I have had the chance to be both a research and lab assistant. Applying PCR and gel electrophoresis to B. miyamotoi samples whilst learning to find, analyze, and communicate scientific articles has taught me much more in a unique, hands-on style, more so than in traditional lectures. I learned about field collection, identified and processed ticks in the lab, and even learned about the business aspect of science.

Deb, always eager to help, helped me to narrow down different REU’s and summer programs to apply to. Furthermore, she helped to edit my résumé and cover letter. As a result, I was accepted into my dream program as a scholar of the UMass Baccalaureate MD (BaccMD) Program at UMass Medical. This past summer, I experienced one month of “medical school boot camp” where I was given the opportunity to take physics and English courses, attend lectures by UMass Medical physicians, leaders from Worcester, and other enrichment speakers. Additionally, I worked in a small group to conduct a research project on the health disparities of LGBT youth in relation to substance abuse in Massachusetts. I will be attending the second session of BaccMD this following summer!

I give my sincere thanks to Deb and the OURs office for their years of support. Without them, I may have missed out on these eye-opening and memorable learning experiences. I highly recommend this resource to anyone (any or no experience, any major) who wants to learn more about research and the myriad of opportunities available to you!"
