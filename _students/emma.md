"My name is Emma Lutz, and I am a junior Microbiology and Public health double major pursuing a dual degree. In the summer of 2015, I had my first experience with independent research at the T.H. Chan Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. I had the opportunity to research malaria, and I worked with a post-doc on constructing a late stage gametocyte-specific fluorescent Plasmodium falciparum line, which would have eventually been used as a tool for screening for host factors that are important for the development of sexual-stage parasites. In addition to learning the basics of molecular cloning, I also became familiar with multiple parasite techniques, including culturing parasites, sorbitol synchronization, MACS purification, performing an invasion assay, and freezing and thawing parasites.

Currently, I am conducting an independent research project at UMass pertaining to the ability of house flies to vector the pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, which causes a debilitating disease called Trachoma that eventually leads to blindness in the infected host. I originally became aware of my ability to participate in these programs through the OURS office at UMass, where people worked with me to find programs that fit my individual needs and requirements. The guidance provided by the OURS office facilitated my participation in paid internships that allowed me to gain valuable experience in the field I am interested in."
