Hello! I am a sophomore on the pre-med track double majoring in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Public Health. I began my research journey the summer after my freshman year when I got accepted into the 2020 William Lee Science Impact Program (Lee SIP). This is an REU at UMass that matches selected students with faculty members with the intentions of having the students work in their lab from that summer until graduation! Through Lee SIP, I joined the Moore Lab in the Food Science Department. My lab focuses on noroviruses and my project is about studying the protein structure of virus particles and viral capsids to assess their structural and molecular dynamics in hopes of connecting them to their persistence against inactivation! My research experience has been amazing so far and I want to be able to help others gain research positions as well! 

I am really looking forward to talking to other students about research interests and helping them find meaningful experiences whether or not if it’s at UMass. The OURS office does an amazing job helping students find great opportunities and I am so glad to be a part of this team! I can’t wait to meet you all and be part of your research journey!
