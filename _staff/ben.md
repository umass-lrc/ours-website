Hello! My name is Benjamin and I am currently a senior on the pre-med track double-majoring in Neuroscience and Biochemistry/Molecular Biology. When I first arrived on campus, I was very interested in working in a research lab. I thought research would allow me to explore my interests and develop new ones along the way! However, the task of reaching out to professors and how to communicate with them was daunting and worrying. With the help of the OURS office, I was able to learn new communication techniques and find many intriguing opportunities for research on campus, leading me to work in the Moorman lab during the second semester of freshman year.

In the Moorman lab I study the neurobiological role of norepinephrine in alcohol and stress. I learned how to administer behavioral and stress tests on mice specimens, safely assemble and use laboratory equipment, monitor alcohol exposure to mice specimens, and carefully inject mice with CNO.

I am extremely thankful for the help the OURS office provided and am excited to be part of this amazing team! I am also very excited to be working with students in finding research opportunities that will open many doors for them in the future!
