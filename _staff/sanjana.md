Hi! I am Sanjana. I am a junior Biochemistry and Molecular Biology major with a minor in Political Science and a letter of specialization in Developmental Disabilities and Human Services on the premed track. I am also a member of the Commonwealth Honors College. I reached out to the OURS department where I learned how to find labs that I was interested in and how to cold email professors in order to receive an interview. I became involved in research my sophomore year of college when I joined the Mager lab in the department of Veterinary and Animal Sciences. The Mager lab is one of the main collaborators of the Knockout Mouse Project. It focuses on genotyping novel gene lines that are believed to be early lethal phenotypes in mice embryos and compares the phenotypes of mutant and wildtype embryos at the preimplantation (E3.5) and gastrulation (E7.5) stages. Joining this lab developed my interest in research and allowed me to learn and hopefully perfect both basic and advanced lab skills such as PCRs, Hematoxylin & Eosin staining, Immunofluorescence, DNA extractions, and RNA extractions.

Ideally, my honors thesis would be to look at a specific set of mouse gene lines and determine their roles in both embryonic development and organismal function as well as the specific phenotypes of their mutant embryos. So far, my research experience has been inspiring and allowed my passion of research to grow. I am very excited to help other students take advantage of all the amazing research opportunities available at UMass and make connections with many students and professors!
