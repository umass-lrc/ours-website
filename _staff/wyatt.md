I am currently a junior on the pre-med track studying Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Microbiology. I have always been interested in working with diseases that significantly impact people from developing countries, so naturally I became interested in learning more about pathogens and infectious diseases. Coming to UMass I wanted to join a lab that aligned with my interests, but I did not know where to start. I reached out to OURS in my freshman year, and I was recommended to many interesting labs, along with useful advice on how to stand out when reaching out to professors. In my sophomore year, I joined the Morita lab in the Microbiology Department, which was one of the labs that OURS recommended to me. Our labâ€™s research focuses on investigating the cellular membrane structure and pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in hopes of finding better treatments against the growing threat of antibiotic resistant tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a curable and preventable disease, yet it still remains one of the leading causes of death in many under-developing countries.

Being an undergraduate research assistant has helped me gain incredible exposure to the research environment, as well as the opportunity to gain experiences while working on different projects within my research of interest. I am very excited, and I look forward to also helping other students find a research experience that they are passionate about from all departments across campus! I hope that I can help other students realize the myriad of opportunities that are available to them both on and off campus.
