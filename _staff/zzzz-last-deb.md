I am the Coordinator of the Office of Undergraduate Research And Studies. This fall I started my eighth year with the office and I have had many memorable experiences and met many amazing students along the way. In my job I meet with students from all majors and levels of experience and I hear about their interests, goals, and stories. With that information, I help them find research or academic experiences in their field of interest. If you are looking for on-campus, off-campus or summer experiences, I am here to help you find opportunities.

If you are not sure if research is for you, or even exactly what research means, set up a meeting with OURS and we will help to answer those questions. I hope to meet with you and look forward to providing whatever help you may need.
