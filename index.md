## Welcome to the Office of Undergraduate Research and Studies (OURS)


 The Office of Undergraduate Research & Studies (OURS) is part of the [Learning Resource Center](https://www.umass.edu/lrc/) and serves as the centralized research and resource office for the campus. OURS helps students find and access undergraduate research and scholarly opportunities on and off campus, throughout the year.  We serve students in all disciplines at every stage of their undergraduate careers. Students are also supported in preparing for and navigating the application process for research and scholarly opportunities.

We meet students in a one on one capacity. For a one-on-one meeting: fill out our [short form](https://umass.campus.eab.com/), email us at [ours@umass.edu](ours@umass.edu), or visit us on the 10th floor of the W. E. B. Du Bois Library.
