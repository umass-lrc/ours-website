# Tutoring by Appointment
Tutoring by Appointment provides students with course-specific academic support in a 1:1 or 2:1 setting. Each semester, we tutor over 100 courses where students commonly need support.  

Tutoring by Appointment at the LRC is available in person in the Du Bois Library or virtually via Zoom, with appointment times available throughout the week.  Tutoring appointments can be scheduled up to 5 days in advance using the “Tutoring Appointments” link on the LRC webpage or by speaking with an LRC team member.
 * Tutoring appointments are 50 minutes long and offer students an opportunity to engage in deep study with a tutor.
 * Focusing on specific course content, tutoring by appointment supports students as they work through questions related to current course topics and formalize knowledge needed to fill learning gaps and clarify misconceptions.
 * To make the most of your time in a tutoring appointment, it’s important to bring your classes resources, have an idea (even a very general idea is helpful!) of where you want to get started, and be ready to engage with your tutor!
 * Because there are a limited number of tutoring appointments available each day, we ask that you cancel appointments you are unable to make at least two hours before the start of your session.
 * You can cancel appointments through Navigate or by speaking with an LRC Team Member!

# Drop-in tutoring
Drop-in Tutoring provides students with course-specific academic support in a 1:1 or small group setting. Drop-in Tutoring is available in person on the 10th Floor of the Du Bois Library or virtually via Zoom. Drop-in times are available throughout the week, but students should use this schedule to determine when drop-in tutoring for their course is offered.
 * Drop-in tutoring sessions are 30 minutes long and are available on a first-come, first-served basis.
 * Drop-in tutoring is most effective when students have specific questions they want to address quickly with their tutor.
 * Drop-in tutoring is meant to help get a student moving over a small comprehension hurdle or to move forward with a small learning goal.
 * While many students come to drop-in tutoring because of questions about an assignment, tutors are encouraged to help students review concepts related to the assignment and will not complete assignments for the student.
 * To opt for a virtual drop-in tutoring session, please call the LRC at 413-545-5334 to be put on our virtual queue.

# Study Tips
Study Tips provides students with the opportunity to discuss the organization, retention, and assignment management skills that help set up a strong foundation for academic achievement.

 * Study Skill sessions are a part of LRC’s Drop-in Tutoring Services and are available on a first-come, first-served basis.
 * In a Study Skill session, students will work with a Peer Mentor Tutor (our most experienced cohort of tutors) to help the student determine successful learning and study strategies that work for them and set goals to guide success.
 * If requested, Study Skill sessions can be expanded into regular check-in meetings by appointment - please contact the LRC to setup regular check in’s - [lrc@umass.edu](mailto:lrc@umass.edu).
 * To access Study Skills – please see our Drop-In tutoring schedule (post link).
