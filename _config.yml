# For every alert you would like to add, specify:
#  - text: the text for the alert, e.g. "The LRC will be closed tomorrow."

#     * info -- light blue

  # There should only be 7 sidebar items. Having more or less will result in
  # ugly unused space. Having fewer than seven isn't _as_ bad, but it's still
